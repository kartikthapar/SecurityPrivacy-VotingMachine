\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The team created a voting machine system in software to demonstrate a working hidden backdoor that can influence the election outcome when triggered using specific actions. This section briefly describes the overall approach to writing a good voting machine system. Section \ref{sec:backdoor}, 'Backdoor For Fun \& Profit' describes the backdoor and its implementation in detail.

\subsection{Voting Machine}

\subsubsection{Parameters}
The entire voting machine is programmed using Python. Python was chosen as the programming (scripting) language for its remarkable flexibility in a number of areas --- designing fast and flexible GUI interfaces, easy file handling \& database management, implementing network connections, efficient and easy cryptography, and ease of document parsing.

\subsubsection{Design}
The voting machine is abstracted into two parts --- \emph{client} and \emph{server}.

\paragraph{Client} is the actual user-end voting machine. This has a simple GUI interface to accomplish the following action-flow---

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Authentication (Login) Screen:} The voter authenticates itself by entering a database registered voterID plus the authentication 4 Byte PIN. For now, the PIN accepts all characters and numbers but the specification only checks for a 4 Byte 'numbered' PIN, for e.g.\ \emph{2525}. The voter must also authenticate using a private key that is generated by the software for the purpose of verification. These private keys and their corresponding public keys are not signed by the root CA, but in the actual implementation, they \textbf{must} be.
	\item \textbf{Selection Screen(s)}: The selection screens are three distinguished ballots that ask the voter to vote for their 'president', 'congress', 'counsel' individually. Over-voting is not allowed; and the voters are warned for under-voting.
\end{enumerate}
	
\paragraph{Server} includes the server handling client requests and the voter-info database. The server authenticates the client, the voter and the votes and acknowledges all requests from the client.
